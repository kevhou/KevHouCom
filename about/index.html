		<h1>hello,</h1> 
		<h2>designer, musician, programmer.</h2>
		<p>My name is Kevin Hou, I specialize in graphic design and programming. I am currently a second year student at the University of Waterloo, pursuing a degree in Computer Science.<br><br>
		I have been programming for 2 years. Over the years I have designed small games and websites. I am interested in making beautiful and functional websites and creative video games. I am currently teaching myself Objective-C and Cocoa Touch for iPhone app development, I will be releasing my apps soon. 
		<br><br>
		As a graphic designer, I have designed logos, posters and brochures for many companies and organizations. My main designing tool is Photoshop, and i have been using for many years. I am very interested in typography and layout design. Please visit the art gallery to look at some of my work.
		<br><br>
		My other interests include music and fashion. Throughout the years I also became a music producer. I mainly produce hip-hop/ pop type instrumentals. Checkout some of my instrumentals on the music page. To me fashion is wearable art, as a designer it is a field I can not ignore. So my friend and I are starting a clothing company called 'Royals Apparel'. To fulfill my dream of being a fashion designer.</p>
